<P><b>Computers are stupid</b><br>
A computer can only do exactly what you tell it to.  If you're not getting the results you want either your syntax is incorrect or you don't understand the rules that govern the computer's response.</P>
<p><b>Making the Web Work</b><br>
The web is an interaction of computers.  It starts when a computer sends a request for a specific documnent. This request is sent via HTTP to a server.  The server locates the page and sends it back to the computer.  The computer and it's browser then translate the page's code and render the images, text, and layout accordingly.
</p><p><b>HTML Markup: Tags & Elements</b><br>
</p>
Tags and elements are used to organize the content of the document. Tags <i>usually</i> include an opening tag and a closing tag.<br>
The two tags combined are often referred to as an "element". 
</p>
<p><b>Attributes</b><br>
Some tags utilize attributes. <br>
Anchors are examples of tags that use attributes. These attributes can determine whether a link opens in the current window, a new window etc. This link to <a href="http:www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> should open in a new browser tab.<br>
Images are also examples of tags that use attributes. Source, hidth & width can all be attributes. This photo is substantially larger than is shown, but has been scaled down using attributes<br><img src="https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/2/AADG5uMGl-SvdV66frgPGS7wikaGH6RYcasNoOMX9S2nFg/12/30949236/jpeg/32x32/1/_/1/2/2015-04-29_19.45.22.jpg/CPT-4A4gASACIAMgBCAFIAYgBygBKAI/relSz0RGimH-f4rrpVaxgDP9n8V_0UhQzlfsOIAXsYk?size=1024x768&size_mode=2" width=200 alt="Fun Pic">
<br>The img tag is one example of a tag that only has an opening tag  
<p><b>Block Vs. Inline</b><br>
Block elements establish and invisible "box" around their contents.  This can provide a more obvious seperation within the body of a documnent.  
The <b>BOLDED</b> headers and their subsequent paragraphs are examples of the p tag, a type of Block tag.<br>
This line is seperated from the previous line with a br tag; effectively a 'line break' that maintains the flow of the paragraph created with the p tag.
